# Checkin

Remote-friendly scrum checkins without the annoying meetings.

An educational student app project originally designed for [Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/). First presented at [Web Directions 2015](http://www.webdirections.org/wd15/#workshops).

## Instructions

Create a repository and implement your own Checkin app. Feel free to recruit other people and work in groups (ideally up to 7 people).


## What's a Scrum Checkin?

In agile development, we strive to implement the minimum effective amount of process to enable [high velocity development](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021).

The scrum meeting is a common element of that minimal process. Its purpose is to allow team members to check in with each other. On each work day, each small team gathers to answer three questions:

* What did you do on the last workday?
* What are you doing today?
* Is there anything blocking you?

Scrum teams should be small, so these meetings should last less than 15 minutes.

But what about distributed teams working in different timezones? And even a 15 minute meeting is still expensive. What if you could get even better visibility without the inefficiency of a meeting?

That's where this app comes in.


## App Requirements

* Allow a user to create and name teams. Users own the teams they create.
* Allow a user to check in with a specific team and answer each of the three scrum questions.
* View the team status: A simple display of each user's most recent checkin.


### Extra credit

* Allow a user to join an existing team.
* Extra credit: Store data on a remote server and let other users sign up. Consider a turnkey solution such as [FireBase](https://www.firebase.com/) or [Parse](https://parse.com/).

That's it. When you've got a working prototype, [open a new issue here](https://github.com/ericelliott/checkin/issues/new?title=Student+Project) with a link to your project.

Here's a simple mock-up of the checkin feature:
